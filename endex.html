        <p>“Workforce development” is an essential component of community economic development in any economic climate, and certainly even more critical during the financial crises we’re experiencing today. Generally speaking, the term has come to describe a relatively wide range of activities, policies and programs employed by geographies to create, sustain and retain a viable workforce that can support current and future business and industry. Beyond this general understanding, it is difficult to gain a consensus as to the definition of workforce development, perhaps because each user of the term approaches it from a different perspective.

            Educational institutions and public and private social service providers, for example, approach workforce development and develop programs from the perspective of the sustainable economic security of the individual. Communities and economic developers, on the other hand, approach workforce development from a different view—that which benefits the sustainable economic growth of a community or region. Still another group—employers—approach workforce development from an organizational perspective, focusing on the skills their business or industry needs to remain competitive in the global marketplace.</p>
        <p>after 6 months we will graduate from gomycode and we want to work and to get paid well so we used this table of data to know where is the right place to work in.</p>
